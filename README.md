Our project is a skincare recommendation system which takes in different things about the users skin and outputs products that would be ideal for them to use. 
This is based on a sephora dataset consisting of moistuizers, cleanser, face masks, eye cream, treatment and sun protection. 
The dataset has attributes about these products such as their item type or label, brand, product name, price, ranking, ingradiants, and ideal skintype the product would be used for.
